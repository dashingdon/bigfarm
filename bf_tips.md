Improvement Tips:

1.	acrobatic kite deco from the championship trader. gives you an extra 25% reps.
2.	more little fields -- Replace large fields with fertile fields. 
3.	replace big cows with small cows. = more candy cows 
4.	more ducks, get mini ducks 
5.	and goats. 
6.	labs to at least level 10 (10 to18), on each farm (eventually No worries about production costs or decos)
7.	Water towers & workshops to level 5,
8.	fish market fill fish contract orders,  Deep Sea Fish are the real money makers. 
9.	The highest scoring products in CC are wildflowers, milk, and eggs.   
10.	getting a few points in a lot of missions equals or is better than trying to win 1  =  Lots of Shelved missions.
11.	Get the Apartment (s)
12.	spin CC wheel lots !!!  
13.	If you want XP's so you lvl up faster, go with Heeha's layouts.  To score higher in Co-champs, go with K3VIN's layouts.  
14.	With what little gold I have (I spend NO Real Money on games), I am purchasing the lowest levels of library handbooks -- Only at 75% discount.  This is  making a Very Big difference.  
15.	To avoid  spending gold when clicking accidently:  There is a box in Settings -- "Gold confirmation" -- I set mine to 1 coin.  I previously lost over $80,000 in gold from "accidental" clicks.
