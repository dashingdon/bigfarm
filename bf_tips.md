## Improvement Tips: [Credit : DrMarky]

1.	acrobatic kite deco from the championship trader. gives you an extra 25% reps.
2.	more little fields -- Replace large fields with fertile fields. 
3.	replace big cows with small cows. = more candy cows 
4.	more ducks, get mini ducks 
5.	and goats. 
6.	labs to at least level 10 (10 to18), on each farm (eventually No worries about production costs or decos)
7.	Water towers & workshops to level 5,
8.	fish market fill fish contract orders,  Deep Sea Fish are the real money makers. 
9.	The highest scoring products in CC are wildflowers, milk, and eggs.   
10.	getting a few points in a lot of missions equals or is better than trying to win 1  =  Lots of Shelved missions.
11.	Get the Apartment (s)
12.	spin CC wheel lots !!!  
13.	If you want XP's so you lvl up faster, go with Heeha's layouts.  To score higher in Co-champs, go with K3VIN's layouts.  
14.	With what little gold I have (I spend NO Real Money on games), I am purchasing the lowest levels of library handbooks -- Only at 75% discount.  This is  making a Very Big difference.  
15.	To avoid  spending gold when clicking accidently:  There is a box in Settings -- "Gold confirmation" -- I set mine to 1 coin.  I previously lost over $80,000 in gold from "accidental" clicks.  


## Horse Meadow [Credit : JVD]

These are the most common mistakes people are making.


1)  Why does my horse never level up?

A:  Your horse isn't leveling up because it is gaining in breeding effects instead of BASIC ATTRIBUTES.  IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.  If you aren't sure, hover over the icon on the wheel.  Only 3 are Basic Atrributes, and 6 are breeding effects. Basic Attributes are the larger icon version of Strength, Agility and Endurance.

2) So where do I find my breeding effects?

A: Your breeding effects are found in the stable.  When you first open the stable, the green tab at the far right will be lit up that says DETAILS.  You need to choose the third tab which says COOPERATIVE MEADOW.  Here you will find your breeding effects

3) I have tons of breeding effects from the Meadow.  Why does it seem like my horse still isn't getting anywhere?
A: This is perhaps because you are choosing breeding effects of show jumping, dressage, and racing.  Or +Jump Power, +Elegance, and +Speed.  

It takes FOUR of these to equal just ONE breeding effect of +strength training, +agility training, or +endurance training.  OR +strength, +agility, or +endurance.

First I pick the best gene pool.  131 is the best this time   https://prnt.sc/iyjs8u

Any remaining points go on breeding effects of +endurance (small icon) https://prnt.sc/iyjwhx

Then click on the big heart button below to breed.  I have 100% chance of leveling up in Agility, and 31% chance of aquiring +1 in endurance training

Your first priority in building a strong horse is to go for the Basic Attributes (large icon) of Strength, Agility and Endurance.  Our Meadow limit is level 200, so please don't get locked out of the Meadow by leveling up to 201.

Second priority are the breeding effects (small icons) of +strength training, +agility training, and +endurance training.  These can be found in the Cooperative Horse Meadow tab in the stable.

Knowing the difference between Attributes and effects are key.  :-)

these combos will increase your horse basic attributes easily and you must do them in the correct order as given:

Combo 1: Brush, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Blanket. (4 items) Basic Attribute of Agility.

Combo 2: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Brush.(5 items) Basic Attribute of Endurance.

Combo 3: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Brush. (6 items)  Basic Attribute of Strength

## Dreamword [Credit : K3VIN]

2 level 1 mills will feed 4 level 1 chickens (candy chickens are best more dung) 

4 level 1 chickens will feed one level 1 silo

1 level 1 silo will feed 3 apples orchards

these numbers change as you buy books

I buy regular houses, save moons for stables and orchards
buy cheap deco's at the start, keep happiness in the green, change out for better deco's as you go....
Use your tractors when you can, they help lots, orchard one and xp tractors are my fav

## Temp Farm [Credit : K3VIN]

Its a good idea to build a temp farm, if you got the time and money, even a small farm can buy you a few northern lights 4x8 duck coops in the trade center, I suggest you build the minimum amount to make coats, even if you don't fallow the quests you'll make enough to buy few ducks for your G farm...

Hint, 2 lv 4 fields, 1 mill lv4, 4 penguins lv4, 1 silo lv4, 1 lv4 Tree grove,  1 lv4 Berry orchard, 1 lv4 sheep pasture, lv4 workshop, will make a coat you can sell for rune stones every 4h

## Big Farm Tips

Various tips shared* with me or are my own
Misc. tips:

Keep building your farms and upgrading constantly. If you have a lot of reg. cows, swap them out for candy or tropical cows when possible, same for chickens (best is candy chickens), ducks, goats, pigs etc. The ducks and cows are especially nice since the themed ones are smaller, so we can have more on farms.

If you can, have workshops and water towers on every farm and maxed level when you can!

Have Farm Labs on all farms, leveled to 11 or 12 (or higher of course) if you can. you want to feed critters and orchards on all farms with premium goods (blue stuff), saves cash! and makes it easier to go full production when ready on Main Farm and Gourmet Farm! 

Definitely build up Flower Farm when you can, that is your big money maker. When not doing other stuff in the Flower Shop I have Honey Cream going... each harvest is about 1.3 million to me as I keep that up to max barn storage (my storage is 10,650). Just about everything on that farm gets sold, either in contracts or outright sales due to keeping everything at max barn storage.

Complete contracts as quickly as you can, my organic is all built up to max at lvl 99 and my fish market, 1 and 2 item contracts are at lvl 99, I am working on building 3 item contracts and at the moment it is lvl 64. I TRASH ALL 4, 5 and 6 item contracts!!! to hard to complete and they take away from my completing the contracts I want.

Level up Lester's Secret Stash so he gives more to your contracts! I am at lvl 23 and saving so I can upgrade to lvl 24 :) (I only need 957 million for the upgrade, LOL). Please note to get the benefit you must click on a radio button under one of the products in the contract.

Build your fishing fleet so you can get the most fish possible, when GGS gives us pools LOL... I seem to get a lot of lobster pools, but that is ok, they are good money and contracts rarely ask for them! I only use Bridgettes and Roys in my trawlers.

Plant sunflower seeds at night, good source of income.
Gathering wood for village: plant corn on main farm, add edge plants. If you have the personal  subscription, set for repeat and use the turbo harvester and swift seeder and set for repeat til you fill your inventory. Then just plant corn to clear fields.

****You must do the combos in the exact order given****

*Combo 1, 4 item: Brush, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Blanket. - Basic Attribute of Agility.

*Combo 2, 5 item: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Brush. - Basic Attribute of Endurance.

*Combo 3, 6 item: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Brush. -  Basic Attribute of Strength

JO=Jumping Obstacle,  H=Hoofpick,  S=Sugarcube (treat), B=Brush (currycomb)
Each combo lands the wheel in one of three possible positions.

4-item alt combos: Jumping Obstacle , H, S, Ball;  OR  B, S, Ball, Comb

5-item alt combo:  B, S, Jumping Obstacle , H, S 

6-item alt combos: Jumping Obstacle , H, S, Jumping Obstacle , H, S; OR  B, S, Jumping Obstacle , H, Pellet, S 

Second priority are the breeding effects (small icons) of +strength training, +agility training, and +endurance training.  These can be found in the Cooperative Horse Meadow tab in the stable.

Knowing the difference between Attributes and effects are key.  :-)

Save this information. You will refer to it.

Attributes are the big pic on the wheel of Strength, Agility, and Endurance.  Please start for these first, then move on to the +breeding effects which are the small pic version of the same thing.

OK, so nobody will remember "Attributes" or "effects".  Just remember the big pics of Strength, Agility, and Endurance show up in what other players see as the level of your horse---upper right corner with pink heart.

The little pics will be hiding in your meadow tab in the stable.

A BIG reminder  200 is the Meadow limit when fully upgraded, at the moment ours is 190.  

Once you hit 189, you should be working on +breeding effects (the little picture version of the dumbell, balance beam and tachometer.)  

These are hidden in the Cooperative Meadow tab in the stable.  These have no limit and continue to make your horse stronger. 

Never pick the large icon - you will level up out of the meadow and your best horse won't be able to get stronger.


## Pleasure Park Tips*:
The below info was particularly helpful to me getting into top 5 to win the Citrus Grove. You just have to keep tweaking decos til you get it the way you want it, and I did it with about 20 stalls. Of course it will depend on who you are playing against. Eventually I will update with different decos that will take less space so I can get a few more stalls. I personally am not trying for 1st place!:
